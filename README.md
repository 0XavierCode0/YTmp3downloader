With this code you can download a song or even a whole playlist from Youtube with Python.

In this project I learned how to work with the Pytube library as well as the glob and shutil libraries.
I learned how to define and call functions, work with files in the operating system, account for errors, and incorporate some basic if statements and for loops.
