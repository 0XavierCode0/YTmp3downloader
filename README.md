# YTmp3downloader
With this code you can download a song or even a whole playlist from Youtube with Python.

In this project I used the Pytube library for Youtube, the MoviePy library to convert filetypes, and the glob and shutil libraries to move files.
I learned how to define and call functions, work with files in the operating system, account for errors, and incorporate some basic if statements and for loops.
